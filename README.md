## What is Data Visualization?

Data visualization is the process of translating large data sets and metrics into charts, graphs and other visuals. The resulting visual representation of data makes it easier to identify and share real-time trends, outliers, and new insights about the information represented in the data.  

As the amount of big data increases, more people are using data visualization tools to access insights on their computer and on mobile devices. Dashboards are used by business people, data analysts, and data scientists to make data-driven business decisions. 
Our eyes are quick for spotting colors and recognizing patterns. When it comes to Vast amounts of data, the first thing we want to do is build visualizations and recognize patterns in order to understand and craft actions to be taken.
Be it generating leads for business websites, drawing insights for healthcare or education and many more. There's no limit to date generation nowadays and first step towards using it in meaningful manner is Data Visualization.
