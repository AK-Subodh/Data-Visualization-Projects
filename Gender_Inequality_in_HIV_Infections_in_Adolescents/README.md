# Gender Inequality in HIV infections in Adolescents

## What is HIV?
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. This means your body's ability to fight diseases is under attack. 
You're vulnerable and exposed to any kind of infection, no matter how common, can quickly turn life threatening for the person having HIV. 
If HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). 
There is currently no effective cure. Once people get HIV, they have it for life.

## Why This Study?
Although, first showed up in early 1980s, even world's most developed nations like US has struggled for a long time and yet this disease remains cureless.
But it could be brought under control through awareness and precautions. 
Unfortunately, lack of awareness is what has led to underdeveloped countries, especially sub-Saharan countries, to show up 1.5 million HIV positive cases in adolescents (10-19 yrs old) in 2021.
And when there is a lack of education, myths and misbelieves come into play and Gender Inequalities rise to a whole new level. 
Sub-Saharan Africa has girls account for 75% of new HIV infections among 10-19 year olds! 

## mothers2mothers (m2m)
Women are bestowed with the blessing of growing and nurturing a new life. Unfortunately, HIV gets transmitted to a newborn through mothers. A newborn with HIV hardly live for approximately 24 months.
m2m initially focused on ending mother-to-child transmission of HIV,but has since evolved their peer-led model to include services tailored for adolescents and their families. 

mothers2mothers, a phenomenal NGO, are implementing critically important work to deliver health, hope, and an HIV-free future for all. Founded in Cape Town, South Africa in 2001, m2m works across 10 African nations, reaching over a
million people each year, with support and partnership from UNICEF (the source of this month’s data).
The m2m model is simple—to train and employ African women living with HIV as frontline health workers. 
These “Mentor Mothers” deliver health education and services to their own communities, while
earning a decent income and changing the narrative about what it means to be a woman living with HIV.


Young women are employed by m2m to work with adolescents and families in their own community to equip them with the skills and
knowledge to keep young people healthy and HIV-free, or to provide adolescent-friendly services to young people living with HIV. And, it’s working. 
In 2019, 96% of m2m’s adolescent clients living with HIV were initiated on treatment—compared to a benchmark of 56% across UNAIDS 35 Fast-Track countries.

## Questions Tried to be answered:

- What is the status of HIV cases over years? 
- Can we check the Gender Ratio of the HIV cases each year?
- How is the gender ratio trend changes with the age of victims?---not possible as data is for adolescent and distribution not given--
- Country-wise situation of HIV cases.
- Region wise situation of HIV cases. Is there any improvement?
- Death cases due to HIV and corresponding age/gender study?
- Which regions are doing better? Is there any trends of Improvement?


## Trends seen in sheets and possible reason/relevance for study:
- **Sheet1 : People Living with HIV over the years**
  
  Line graph is plot to see the total estimated number of people that live over the years.
  We can see that estimated number of people living with HIV keeps on increasing over the years for both sex.
  But we cannot jump to conclusions straight. It As population increases ratio must not increase. Also Study is conducted over short span of 40 years.
  Internet says that the average life span of people found positive at the age of 21 is 36years. But our dataset is only of adolescent.

- **Sheet2: New HIV cases per 1000 uninfected population over the years.**
  
  Here we could see that there is clear drop in the number of new cases w.r.t the population. The change is more drastic in case of females, which is good news.
  Peak touched in 1995. We need to search for the reason for sharp drop from there.
  *P.S: 1995-1999- "Guidelines issued to prevent opportunistic inffections(OIs) and for the use of antiretroviral therapy. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) introduced;
       AIDS death decline. US racial/ethnic disparities are notable. *Africa efforts expand*.
       CDC issued first guidelines to help healthcare providers preven OLs in people living with HIV.*

- **Sheet3: New HIV cases over the years**

  Trend is similar to the previous sheet. 
  It's just that the curve lost it's shrpness as compared to sheet2.
  Reason: This sheet is accumulation of cases over time and does not take into consideration the growth of population.

- **SHeet4: Cases resulting into deaths**
 
  Total deaths rose sharply unptil 2008. This point has sharp turning point. We need to check out the event leading to this change. 
  To have a closer look at the situation with life-threatening impact of HIV, we'll look a little further. Calculated the ratio of deaths per total new cases and deaths per total cases in a year.
  

- **Sheet5,6 & 7: Deadly Impact of HIV over years**
  
  Deaths per new cases is on the rise while deaths-total cases ratio is changing. Two turning poins are the years 1995 and 2008.
  New cases per 100000 cases is on the drop from 1995 and 2008. This might also be the reason for the ratio to grow bigger. Or is the impact of disease growing deadlier?

- **Sheet10: Region-wise comparision**

  Eastern and Southern Africa situation for females Have seen the most discrimation.   
  
**Constructive suggestions are always welcome**
